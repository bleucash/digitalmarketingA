<h4>Additional Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test the New URL</strong>: After uploading, verify the raw <code>.md</code> URL in a browser—it should show clean Markdown text. Then add it to GHL and preview queries.</li>
<li><strong>If Still Issues</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Try a GitHub Gist for a simpler host (paste the MD content at gist.github.com > Public > Raw URL).</li>
<li>Check GHL logs for errors (e.g., "Parsing failed"). If needed, contact GHL support with the URL.</li>
<li>For advanced setups, use tools like Rehelply to create a white-label KB that feeds into GHL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Why This Fixed Version Works Better</strong>: It's pure Markdown, structured with consistent headers and lists for easy parsing, and expanded slightly for completeness (e.g., added service details from your original KB to avoid empty sections like "Services").</li>
</ul>
<p>If you share the exact error message from GHL or need help with the upload, I can troubleshoot further!</p></artifact>
